# Changesets

This repository uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning and changelogs. Contributors should run `pnpm changeset` whenever a change affects a published package. The generated markdown files are committed alongside the code until the automated release workflow publishes a new version.
