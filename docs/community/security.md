# Security Policy

The Nura.js maintainers take the security of our users and their data seriously. We appreciate responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities and will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the latest minor release of each active major version. Older releases may receive fixes at the maintainers' discretion.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| main | Yes |
| < latest major | Best effort (backported when feasible) |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Email: [security@nura.dev](mailto:security@nura.dev)
- Please include a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce, affected versions, and any known mitigations.
- **Do not** open a public issue for security reports.

We aim to acknowledge receipt of security reports within **2 business days**. After triage we will keep you informed of the remediation status and expected timelines.

## Disclosure Process

1. We confirm the vulnerability and determine the impact.
2. We develop and validate a fix, collaborating with you when possible.
3. We prepare a release containing the fix and draft security advisories.
4. We publicly disclose the vulnerability once a fix is available, or coordinate a disclosure date if additional time is required.

Thank you for helping us keep Nura.js safe for everyone.
