# Governance

Nura.js is maintained by the Nura.js Maintainers team. We strive for an open and collaborative governance model that balances fast iteration with long-term sustainability.

## Roles

- **Maintainers**: Own the project vision, review contributions, and publish releases.
- **Contributors**: Anyone participating through issues, discussions, documentation, or code changes.

Current maintainers:

- @maintainers (placeholder — update with individual accounts when ready)

## Decision Making

We follow a lightweight Request for Comments (RFC) process for impactful changes to architecture, APIs, or governance.

1. Propose an RFC or Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in `docs/adr/`.
2. Discuss with maintainers and the community via GitHub Discussions or pull requests.
3. Achieve consensus; if consensus is not possible, maintainers make the final decision.

## Release Management

- Releases follow Semantic Versioning and use Changesets for automation.
- Release candidates and deprecations are announced in GitHub Discussions and release notes.

## Changes to Governance

Suggestions to improve this document are welcome. Open an issue or PR describing the change; maintainers will review and coordinate with the community.
